# All_Supported_Nd_Vectors_BMCIF

## Overview
This repository provides a Python implementation of the algorithms for determining all Supported Nondominated Vectors in Bi-objective Minimum Cost Integer Flow (BMCIF) problems. The methods implemented are based on decision-space and/or outcome-space approaches presented in the following paper:

## Repository Structure
The repository contains the following folders:
- **`src/`**: Contains Python source code implementing the algorithms.
- **`instances/`**: Includes test instances used for benchmarking.
- **`output/`**: Stores the results generated by the algorithm. 

## Features
- Implements decision-space and outcome-space methods for solving BMCIF problems.
- Supports various test instances for validation and performance evaluation.
- Outputs the number supported nondominated vectors (and extreme supported vectors) and needed time for each of the different methods.
